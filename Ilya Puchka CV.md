##Experience

####Senior iOS developer @ [HelloFresh](http://www.hellofresh.com), Berlin
*December'15 - present*

Being part of the original iOS team, I took care of different features and areas of the app, while improving the overall quality and getting rid of legacy code left by several third party agencies. I had to rewrite the API client from scratch. I took this opportunity to improve the architecture, quality of the code, stability, and test coverage. I also took care of defining and pushing forward architectural changes across the whole app. Examples of these would be: moving away from massive view controllers to services oriented architecture, following single responsibility principle, using value types, managing views using view models (without reactive aprroach though), breaking app in smaller modules (in-house frameworks) to solve the problem of Swift build times and code isolation, Swift 3 migration, pushed integration of tools such as swiftlint, and writing unit tests. 

After an internal re-organisation of the teams, I was assigned to work on the most importent areas of the app, which is customer subscriptions management. My responsibiities also included building new features from the ground up while liasing with developers from other platforms (Backend, Android, and Web), UX designers, and product owners. Also with team growing became an iOS Chapter Lead in my tribe, leading other two developers.


####iOS developer @ [Wire](http://www.wire.com), Berlin
*April'15 - December'15*
 
As a member of the synchronization framework team, I worked on new product features like group calling, phone number registration and many others. Our work involved TDD, code review and pair programming practices on a daily basis. Some of the main technologies I worked with, are Core Data, Swift, Protocol Buffers, Carthage, and CI with Xcode Bots. I was also taking part in technical interviews.

####Senior iOS Developer @ [Rambler&Co](http://tinyurl.com/qzy2yeb), Moscow
*May'14 - April'15*

At Rambler, I worked as a senior iOS developer while leading our team, which started with 4 developers and grew up to 10 developers. I advocated good practices such as code review, common code style among projects, developers meetups, technologies like [Typhoon framework](http://typhoonframework.org), and architecture design with SOLID principles. At the same time, I was supporting number of applications and took the main role in developing [Afisha Restaurants](https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/afisa-restorany/id916815434?mt=8) app.

####iOS Developer @ target@Mail.Ru, [Mail.RU Group](https://corp.mail.ru/en/), Moscow
*September'13 - May'14*

At target@Mail.Ru, I worked on iOS framework for mobile in-house ads network. I developed components that used Javascript and web views to render ads and separate scalable components to build native ads on top of them. Framework was successfully integrated in all major applications of Mail.RU Group.

####iOS Developer, [Denivip Media](http://www.denivip.ru/en.html), Moscow
*March'12 - September'13*

It was my first job as professional developer. Here, I worked on several VOD/Live video services based on HLS and custom AVPlayers (NTV plus TV, RFPL, UEFA), with in-app purchases, push notifications, user authorization, and offline access. I also worked on an in-house startup project for realtime charts and drawing editor with team access for iPad.

####[CoolConnections](http://www.coolconnections.ru/en), Moscow
*September'10 – March'12*   

At Coolconnections, I managed all technical aspects of events held by company. I managed different cinema events like Japanese, Brazilian, Korean, Hong-Kong film festivals in Moscow. I developed the iOS app for the company's events main venue - 35mm cinema hall.
