##Experience

####Senior iOS developer @ [HelloFresh](http://www.hellofresh.com), Berlin
*December'15 - current time*

Originally as a member of iOS team took care of different features and areas of the app functionality, improving quality and getting rid of legacy left by several 3rd party agenceis. Rewrote API client from scratch, improving it's quality, stability, test coverage and architecture. Defined and pushed forward architectural changes across the whole app, i.e. moving away from massive view controllers to services oriented architecture, closer following SR principle, using value types, managing views using view models (without reactive aprroach though), breaking app in smaller modules (inhouse frameworks) to solve the problem of Swift build times and code isolation, took care (in pair with another developer) of Swift 3 migration, pushed integration of such tools like swiftlint and writing unit tests. After reorganizing into feature teams continued to work on one of the most important areas of the app which is customer subscriptions management, building new features from groud up in close contact with developers for all other platforms (backend, android, web), UX designers and POs.
